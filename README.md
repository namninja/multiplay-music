### Summary

A multi-API hack that lets you learn a song by providing videos, tablature, and lyrics.  The main 
API that the site draws from is Songsterr. The motivation for this site was to create a one stop shop 
for learning music. I play guitar and have used Songsterr before. It's a great technology for learning 
songs through tablature, however Songsterr does not provide lyrics. My main workflow for learning a song: 
listening to it, learning the chords, and then learning the lyrics. I often go back and forth until 
I can play along and sing with the song.  Basically, this idea is for my own personal convenience.
